Welcome to Arman Saadat and Zane Metz's Exact code solution.
longest_path_exact_solution.py solves the Longest Path problem in O(n! * n) time.
If this is the first time you are testing the solution code with the shell script, enter the following command into the terminal:
                chmod +x run_test_cases.sh
Now, to test the code, enter the following command into the terminal:
                ./run_test_cases.sh

To run a test that will take at least 20 mins (it will never finish), run the following command:

      python3 longest_path_exact_solution.py < test_cases/longest_path.graph.txt
